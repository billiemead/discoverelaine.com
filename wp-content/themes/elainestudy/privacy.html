    <p class="es-p"><strong class="privacy-bold">Medical Information</strong></p>

    <p class="es-p">Protected health information (“PHI”) is information about you that may be used to identify you (such as your name, social security number, or address), and that relates to (a) your past, present, or future physical or mental health or condition, (b) the provision of healthcare to you, or (c) your past, present, or future payment for the provision of health care. In providing our services, we will receive and create records containing your PHI, and may use it to assist you in administering our clinical trials or treatments, develop and conduct surveys with you to assist in providing you better services, conduct our management and administrative activities, and otherwise, as stated in this Privacy Policy.</p>

    <p class="es-p">We may also use your de-identified PHI to help us learn from your experience and contribute to research. We are committed to ensuring the quality and effectiveness of our services and our Services (including our mobile application), and therefore periodically evaluate the outcomes and experiences of our users. Any information you provide, usage data, or answers you submit to questions in this program may be grouped with information from other users and analyzed in a fully de-identified manner (without your name or other identifying information) to assess the quality of our Services (including our App). This anonymous aggregate information may also be used in scientific research publications and presentations. We are required by law to maintain the privacy and confidentiality of your PHI, and we operate the Services (including our App) in compliance with applicable federal and state laws governing health information privacy and security. All medical or health information that we collect is in compliance with HIPAA. All of our systems and platforms are HIPAA-compliant, meaning that we take steps such as encryption of all stored personal information and data transmissions and two-factor authentication of any human-readable data with internal access provided only to appropriate administrators.</p>

<h2 class="h2-heading">Choices About How We Use and Disclose Your Information</h2>
    <p class="es-p">We strive to provide you with choices regarding the personal information you provide to us. We have created mechanisms to provide you with the following control over your information:</p>

    <p class="es-p"><strong>• Tracking Technologies and Advertising.</strong> You can set your browser to refuse all or some browser cookies, or to alert you when cookies are being sent. If you disable or refuse cookies, please note that some parts of this site may then be inaccessible or not function properly.</p>

However, these third parties may provide you with ways to choose not to have your information collected or used in this way. You can opt out of receiving targeted ads from members of the Network Advertising Initiative (“NAI”) on the NAI’s website, <a target="_blank" class="privacy-link" href="http://optout.networkadvertising.org/" rel="noopener"> optout.networkadvertising.org</a></p>

<h2 class="h2-heading">Data Security</h2>
    <p class="es-p">We have implemented measures designed to secure your personal information from accidental loss and from unauthorized access, use, alteration, and disclosure. We have implemented data security features in compliance with HIPAA. Users should not share HIPAA-protected patient information, including PHI, on any public-facing components or features of the Services. We are not responsible for any breaches of HIPAA requirements or unauthorized disclosure of PHI by you or any third parties on our Website or App. For more information with regard to PHI, please see the “Medical Information” section, above.</p>

    <p class="es-p">The safety and security of your information also depends on you.

<h2 class="h2-heading">Your California Privacy Rights</h2>
    <p class="es-p">If you are a California resident, California law may provide you with additional rights regarding our use of your personal information.</p>

    <p class="es-p">The Company is currently exempt from the provisions of the California Consumer Privacy Act (“<strong>CCPA</strong>”). Further, the CCPA does not apply to any PHI we collect; this Your California Privacy Rights does not create any additional rights or privileges for you as it relates to PHI.</p>

    <p class="es-p">We currently do not sell any of your personal information or PHI to third parties.</p>

    <p class="es-p">California’s Online Privacy Protection Act (Cal. Bus. &amp; Prof. C. §§22575-22579) (“<strong>CalOPPA</strong>”), requires website operators to disclose how they respond to web browser “do not track” signals or other similar mechanisms that provide consumers with the ability to exercise choice regarding the collection of personally identifiable information of a consumer over time and across third party websites and apps, to the extent the operator engages in that collection. At this time, we do not respond to Do Not Track (DNT) signals. This law also requires website and app operators to disclose whether third parties may collect personally identifiable information about their users’ online activities over time and across different websites and apps when the users use the operator’s website or app. The nature of how third parties may collect or receive personally identifiable information is disclosed in this Privacy Policy. To learn more about how Do Not Track signals work, please visit <a target="_blank" class="privacy-link" href="http://allaboutdnt.com/" rel="noopener"> allaboutdnt.com</a>.</p>

    <p class="es-p">California’s “Shine the Light” law (Civil Code Section § 1798.83) permits users of our Services that are California residents to request certain information regarding our disclosure of personal information to third parties for their direct marketing purposes. We do not currently disclose personal information to third parties for their direct marketing purposes. However, to make such a request, please send an email to <a class="privacy-link" href="mailto:info@metamehealth.com" >info@metamehealth.com</a>. Please allow us 30 days for a response.</p>
